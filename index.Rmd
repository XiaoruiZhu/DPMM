## Dirichlet Process

$DP$ is a random measure defined as $$\mu = \sum^{\infty}_{n=1} p_n \delta_{\phi_n}, $$ where $(p_n)_{n\in N}$ are random weights by stick-breaking construction with parameter $\theta$ and $(\phi_n)_{n\in N} \overset{iid}{\sim} G_0$ "the base measure". 

Therefore, $\mu \sim DP(\theta, G_0)$ has following repressentation: 

$$\begin{array}
  {rl}
  \mu & = \;  \displaystyle \sum^{\infty}_{i=1} \Big[ V_i \prod^{i-1}_{j=1}(1-V_j) \Big] \delta_{\phi_i} \\
  V_i & \overset{iid}{\sim} \; Beta(1, \theta) \\
  \phi_i & \overset{iid}{\sim} \; G_0
  \end{array}$$

## Stick-Breaking and CRP

1. CRP Theorem 10.5: $\text{lim}_{n\rightarrow\infty}K_n/\text{log}n = \theta$ almost surely.

```{r echo = F, results = 'asis', fig.width=6, fig.height=5, fig.align='center'}
load(file = "data/Them10_5.Rdata")
plot(Them10_5$ratio~Them10_5$n, type="l")
```

## MCMC & Gibbs Sampler

1. **Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation(MCMC):** is a general method based on drawing values of θ from approximate distributions and then correcting those draws to better approximate the target posterior distribution, p(θ|y). 

2. **Gibbs Sampler:** also called alternating conditional sampling. Each iteration draws each subset conditional on the value of all the others ($\theta = (\theta_1, \cdots , \theta_d)$).

## Statistical results

- The differences in **IFF/Attempt** between gender are not significantly different.

```{r echo = F, results = 'asis', fig.width=10,fig.height=7, fig.align="center"}

```

## Statistical results

- The differences in **Creative outcome/T-value** between countries are significantly different. 

```{r echo = F, results = 'asis', fig.width=10,fig.height=7, fig.align="center"}

```
